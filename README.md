# Snake written in Bevy Rust
I followed this fantastic guide which is a great introduction to Bevy, which takes you step by step through creating a snake game.

There are improvements to be done:
- ~~Make it look better.~~
- ~~Make food spawn one at a time.~~
- ~~Make food not spawn on the snake's body.~~
- ~~Add a different variable to track last head position to prevent the snake head from colliding with itself.~~
- Add score keeping.
- Add buttons to start and restart the game.
- Add the option to play with 2 players.

Then eventually code an AI to play the game.
