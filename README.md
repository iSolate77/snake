# Snake written in Bevy Rust
I followed this fantastic guide which is a great introduction to Bevy, which takes you step by step through creating a snake game.

There are improvements to be done:
- Make it look better
- Make food spawn one at a time
- Make food not spawn on the snake's body

Then eventually code an AI to play the game.
